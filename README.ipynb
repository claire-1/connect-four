Connect four is a great way to pass the time because it requires some thought, careful observation, and is good for all ages!

    "Python was a really good choice for this project. Pygame made graphics and animation super easy. I usually use Java but have never done any animation in Java. I would imagine that it would require more code than I needed for this project. I also found python dictionaries and tuples very easy to work with. Dictionaries made it easy to keep track of where on the screen spaces were and what tiles had been filled in. Tuples made it easy to return many values from a function at once without having to make new classes, which was very convenient. Additionally, heapq worked well as a priority queue, although it was a little confusing to use in the beginning. \n",

    "My biggest problem was that running the connect four game with graphics drained by battery pretty quickly. I followed one post's suggestions (attributed above) to quit the pygame mixer, and that seemed to help some. \n",
    "\n",
    "I also had some tricky bugs. One was where if you clicked on a filled in tile, the board would mark the first open tile in that column as taken in my dictionary, but the animation wouldn't show it being filled. I had to rework my animation function to always fill in the destination slot to fix this issue."
